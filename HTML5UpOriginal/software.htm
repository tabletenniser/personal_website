		<h5>Connect of Five</h5>
		<p class="description">&emsp; &emsp; This project was originally accomplished by me in 2009 and later modified in 2012 using Java. Connect of five or Gomoku is a simple chess game where two players place black and white stones in turn with black going first. The winner is determined to be the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku">here</a> for more information about the game). My program contains three major functionalities: enable the user to play against the computer with an attempted AI (Artificial Intelligence), allow two users to play against each other on the same computer and replay a previous game stored. An executable .jar file is available here:<br/>
		<button class="download" onclick="javascript: window.open('files/connect_of_five_v1.1.zip','_self');">Download Connect_of_five_v1.1.zip</button><br/>
		Instructions on how to execute this project:<br/>
		&emsp;&emsp; 1) Download the Java runtime environment from <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a> if you do not have it. <br/>
		&emsp;&emsp; 2) Download and run jarfix.exe (a freeware provided by Softpedia) from <a href="files/jarfix.exe">here</a> to set up environmental variables.<br/>
		&emsp;&emsp; 3) Extract the Connect_of_five_v1.1.zip  into some editable directory and double click on the Connect_of_five_v1.1.jar to execute the program.</p><br/>

		<h5>One-to-one Chat Website</h5>
		<p class="description">&emsp;&emsp; This project was created by me in August, 2012 as a practice to study website development techniques including HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP amd simple mySQL database design. It includes common features like instant messaging, report and test the other user. Note that a registration with a valid email address is required to access those features, and test accounts are available as: test1@jk.com (pwd: test1) and test2@jk.com (pwd:test2).

		<h5>Image Wavelength and Video Frequency Measurement</h5>
		<p class="description">&emsp;&emsp; Those two programs utilize 2D Fourier Transform to measure most dominant wavelength of a giving pattern image and frequency of a peiodic video. They were created by Jeremy McGibbon in 2011 and later modified by me in 2012 as part of the SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship) program in order to expedite data analysis process in vertically vibrated granular substances. Unfortunately, as a nature of the fellowship program, those projects are copyrighted by University of Toronto and cannot be uploaded here. </p>

		<h5>Game of 24</h5>
		<p class="description">This was my final project for Grade 10 computer science course in 2009. Game of 24 is a traditional arithmetic card game in which the player manipulates simple arithmetic operations on four randomly chosen cards to make up the target number 24 (check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game</a> for details). This project implements this game with a user friendly graphic user interface with functionalities like to evaluate an expression entered by the user as well as to display the correct answer for the random selected cards using a Binary Expression Tree.  An executable version of this project is available from:

		Instructions on how to run this application on Windows: <br/>
		&emsp;&emsp;  1) Click on the Download Game of 24 button above. <br/>	
		&emsp;&emsp;  2) Extract the .zip file into some editable location.<br/>
		&emsp;&emsp;  3) Run Turing.exe under Turing 4.1.1 folder. (Unfortunately, Holt Software, the company that invented Turing went out of business and this language has become a freeware afterwards)<br/>
		&emsp;&emsp;  4) Select File --> Open and find the game_of_24.t file. <br/>
		&emsp;&emsp;  5) Click on the Run button in the Turing IDE to execute the program.<br/>
