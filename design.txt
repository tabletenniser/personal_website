	DONE: intro: 
		This section provides a brief summary on my programming background. In particular, it contains a list of past learning experience both in school and by myself, an up-to-date summary of related skills and a list of all past programming projects.
	DONE: timeline:
		-Sept, 2008: first started programming using Visual Basic by myself as a personal interest
		-Sept, 2009: took Gr10 computer science in Turing focusing on basic programming structures like loops and 
		-Apr, 2010: took Gr11 computer science in Java focusing on OOP
		-Sept, 2010: took Gr12 computer science in Java focusing on simple algorithms like recursion, sorting and searching
		-Sept, 2011: took first year advanced comp sci course (CSC192) in C focusing on programming efficiency and data structures linke queues, stacks, linked lists and binary trees
		-Apr, 2012: Studied C++ by myself as an extension of CSC192 course
		-July, 2012: Joined Frosh website club and started on website development using html5, css3 and javascript for front end with php and mySql for back end
		-Dec, 2012: Stepped into Android app development using the SDK provided by Google in Eclipse using Java
	DONE: skills_summary:
		Languages
			-java: A language that I am mostly familiar with today, first started three years ago and familiar with Eclipse and jGrasp as the IDE.
			-C/C++: Studied C language in 2012 and C++ by myself, most projects are algorithm-based for learning purpose instead of real applications. Used CodeBlocks as the IDE.
			-Matlab: Studied in school for two semesters, is able to solve complicated computation problems.
			-HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and PHP: Used for website development, mostly project-based learning experience.
			-Python, Visual Basic and Turing: Languages that I have learned with relevant past experience yet I am not very familiar their syntax today.
		Data structure:
			-Familiar with different types of linked lists and their memory representation.
			-Knowledge of stacks, queues, map????? set????? and binary trees with their implementations.
		Algorithms:
			-Familiar with common sorting algorithms like insertion, selection, heap sort, quick sort and merge sort.
			-Knowledge of simple graph algorithms including breadth-first and depth-first traverse, Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.
		Object-oriented Programming:
			-Mostly did in Java with a little bit in java.
			-Familiar with common concepts like data abstraction, data encryption, inheritance, polymorphism and object-based type castings.
		GUI (Graphic User Interface) development:
			-In Java and Turing
			-Used the Swing package for user interface layout and awt.event package to deal with user interations (i.e events). Also utilized multi-threading for devices like timers.
		Database:
			-Relevant experience in dealing with small-size mySql database for website development
		Mobile app:
			-Beginner in Android app mobile development using android SDK plug-in and ADT emulator in Eclipse. Started in Dec, 2012.

4. hardware.html:
	DONE: introduction + skills summary
5. tt_life.html: 
	DONE: introduction, best_results,
	REQUIRE: photo gallary, youtube_video
6. contact_me.html:
	USE THE ONE FROM index.html

7.GALLERY:

FINALLY: USE EM/PX TO FORMAT ALL FONTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THINGS TO CHECK:
1. # and < operators in css: # is for id, .for class, < for child of an element
2. difference between px and em: em depends on the user's browser size; px is absolute depending on the browser ==> 1 em is equal to the size of the CURRENT FONT
3. alt property for pictures: alternative text if the image cannot be displayed
