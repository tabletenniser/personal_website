Connect of five (or Gomoku) is a simple chess game where two players place black and white stones in turn with black going first. The winner is determined to be the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku">here</a> for more information about the game). The program is implmented in Java with three major functionalities: 1) Allows the user to play against the AI (not so smart but playable :(); 2) Allows two users to play against each other on the same computer and 3) Replay a previous game stored. An executable .jar file is available here:<br/>

                                                        This was my final project for Grade 10 computer science course in 2009. Game of 24 is a traditional arithmetic card game in which the player manipulates simple arithmetic operations on four randomly chosen cards to make up the target number 24 (check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game</a> for details). This project implements this game with a user friendly graphic user interface with functionalities like to evaluate an expression entered by the user as well as to display the correct answer for the random selected cards using a Binary Expression Tree.  An executable version of this project is available from:
